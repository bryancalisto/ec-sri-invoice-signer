## Reporting a Vulnerability 🤝

If you find a vulnerability in this package, please send an email to bryancalisto@yahoo.es explaining what's the vulnerability about and how to exploit it.
I will normally answer in less than 1 day. I won't give a money prize, but will give credit in the repository if the vulnerability is valid.
